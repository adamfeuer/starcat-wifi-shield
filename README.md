Arietta Shield
==============

This is an Arduino Due shield for the 
[Arietta SAM9G Linux module](http://www.acmesystems.it/arietta).

The purpose of this shield is to connect the Arduino Due to the Internet
via a USB connection to Linux running on the wifi-enabled Arietta board.

Eventually I would like to get OpenWRT running on this board instead of Debian,
so users can run a software stack similar to the [Arduino Yún](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardYun?from=Products.ArduinoYUN).

This board has not been tested. I can't provide support for it.
If you want to make one, you're on your own. Good luck!


Features
========

* USB type A female connector that powers the Arietta module.
* Use a short male micro-B to male type A USB cable to connect the Arietta shield to the Arduino Due.
 * [5 inch male micro-B to male A cable](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JX1260Y/) - this is inexpensive and works well
 * Provides USB 2.0 480Mbps connection to the Arduino Due using equal-length differential traces.
